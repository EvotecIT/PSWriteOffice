# PSWriteOffice Benchmarks

PSWriteOffice benchmarks use the PSPublishModule/PowerForge benchmark DSL. The
suite is split by file format so workbook behavior is compared with workbook
tools and CSV behavior is compared with CSV tools.

## Excel

`Compare-ExcelPerformance.ps1` measures OfficeIMO-backed PSWriteOffice Excel
cmdlets against PowerShell-facing Excel alternatives:

- `PSWriteOffice`
- `ImportExcel`
- `ExcelFast` for the workbook lanes it supports

Excel smoke, standard, and full suites use five measured iterations; large and
super-large suites use three. The grouped rotation keeps comparable workbook
engines adjacent and alternates which engine runs first. PowerForge performs an
explicit managed-memory cleanup after setup and data creation, outside the timed
operation, so allocations from one engine do not become another engine's GC bill.

Every read comparison uses the same PSWriteOffice-produced workbook shape for
the selected row count. The competing readers do not benchmark files created by
their own writers.

The current ExcelFast 0.0.1-alpha16 writer places an empty drawing element in an
invalid worksheet position. Its write lane therefore includes ExcelFast's own
`Get-Workbook` and `Save-Workbook` normalization inside the timed operation.
This keeps ExcelFast in the comparison without reporting malformed-workbook
speed as a valid result.

ExcelFast's mixed-object writer currently stores booleans, dates, and numbers
as culture-formatted text cells. Mixed and wide typed write lanes are therefore
not equivalent and remain excluded. The ExcelFast write comparison uses the
text-only default shape, while read lanes use the same PSWriteOffice-produced
typed workbook fixture as every other reader.

Runs that include PSWriteOffice build directly against a complete OfficeIMO
source checkout. With sibling PSWriteOffice and OfficeIMO checkouts, set the
source root once for the current shell:

```powershell
$env:OfficeIMORoot = (Resolve-Path ..\OfficeIMO).Path

## CSV

`Compare-CsvPerformance.ps1` measures PSWriteOffice CSV cmdlets against native
PowerShell CSV import/export:

- `PSWriteOffice`
- `NativeCsv`

The CSV release gate uses 25 measured iterations for suites that include the
short 1,000-row lanes. Large and super-large suites use 11 and 7 iterations,
respectively. PowerForge keeps each scenario comparison together and alternates
engine order between iterations, so neither engine keeps the first or second
position. An explicit managed-memory cleanup runs after setup and data creation,
outside the timed operation, for every engine. Use `-RepeatCount` for an
intentional diagnostic override; keep the defaults when recording release or
README results.

The CSV suite also includes dbatools-shaped read scenarios over the same
generated CSV shape used by `dataplat/dbatools.library/benchmarks/CsvBenchmarks`.
`csv-dbatools-quick-single-column` and `csv-dbatools-quick-all-columns` cover the
upstream `QuickTest` pattern and the small/medium/large reader shape by changing
`-RowCount`. The explicit `csv-dbatools-wide-*` and `csv-dbatools-quoted-*`
lanes cover the upstream wide 50-column and quote-all files.

The `csv-read-datatable-*` lanes compare `Import-OfficeCsv -AsDataTable` with a
native PowerShell baseline that reads via `Import-Csv` and fills a `DataTable`.
That keeps the database/table workflow visible instead of comparing only
PowerShell object materialization.

The `csv-write-gzip-*` and `csv-read-gzip-datatable-*` lanes keep compressed
CSV in the same benchmark matrix. The native baseline uses `GZipStream` with
`ConvertTo-Csv` / `ConvertFrom-Csv`, while PSWriteOffice uses
`Export-OfficeCsv -CompressionType GZip` and
`Import-OfficeCsv -CompressionType GZip`.

CSV runs that include PSWriteOffice use the same direct OfficeIMO source root:

```powershell
$env:OfficeIMORoot = (Resolve-Path ..\OfficeIMO).Path
```

### CSV Capability Coverage

The CSV benchmarks sit next to feature coverage on purpose: the target is fast
and correct, not a narrow parser trick. They measure the CSV reader and writer
paths used by PSWriteOffice, including streaming, compression, typed values, and
round-trip validation.

| Capability | Current PSWriteOffice / OfficeIMO.CSV support | Benchmark visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streaming reads | `Import-OfficeCsv` streams rows by default; `-AsDataTable` materializes one table when the next hop is tabular | Object read lanes and DataTable read lanes |
| Streaming writes | `Export-OfficeCsv` accepts objects, `DataTable`, `DataView`, and `IDataReader` input | Object/DataTable write lanes; DbaClientX export benchmark covers direct `IDataReader` SQL export |
| Compression | `Export-OfficeCsv` / `Import-OfficeCsv` expose `-CompressionType`; OfficeIMO.CSV supports none, auto, GZip, Deflate, and runtime-supported Brotli/ZLib | GZip write/read DataTable lanes |
| Cancellation | OfficeIMO.CSV accepts a cancellation token; PSWriteOffice cancels it from `StopProcessing`, so Ctrl+C can stop long reads | Contract coverage, not timed by default |
| Progress | OfficeIMO.CSV exposes progress callbacks; PSWriteOffice exposes `-ProgressInterval` and writes PowerShell progress records | Contract coverage, not timed by default |
| Schema and typed tables | OfficeIMO.CSV supports explicit/inferred schema, `DataTable`, and `IDataReader` schema tables; PSWriteOffice exposes `Import-OfficeCsv -AsDataTable -InferSchema` and `Import-OfficeCsv -AsDataReader -ColumnType` | DataTable read lanes; DbaClientX round-trip uses schema-aware reader handoff |
| CSV dialects | Culture/list separator, delimiter detection, multi-character delimiters, no-header/custom headers, comments, W3C headers, null values, date formats, quote modes, and selected quote fields | Default benchmark dialect plus focused command tests |
| Robust parsing | Duplicate-header policy, row-length mismatch policy, strict/lenient quotes, parse-error collection/skip-row, max field length, decompression limits, smart-quote normalization, and string interning | Command/core tests; timed lanes stay on clean generated files |
| Platform shape | PSWriteOffice targets Windows PowerShell/.NET Framework and PowerShell 7/.NET; Brotli/ZLib depend on runtime support, and comparison tools such as `bcp`/FastBCP/dbatools must be installed locally | Benchmarks skip unavailable optional engines |

## Options

The wrappers build PSWriteOffice in `Release` mode by default and import local
development binaries when a selected run includes `PSWriteOffice`. Use
`-PSWriteOfficeConfiguration Debug` for diagnostics or `-SkipPSWriteOfficeBuild`
when reusing an existing local build. Quick and focused runs leave this
README unchanged unless `-UpdateReadme` is specified.

PSWriteOffice benchmark lanes require the current OfficeIMO source tree. Pass
`-OfficeIMORoot`, or set the `OfficeIMORoot` environment variable, so the build
uses direct project references. The wrappers stop instead of falling back to a
published OfficeIMO package when the source path is missing:

```powershell
$evotecRoot = if ($env:EVOTEC_GITHUB_ROOT) { $env:EVOTEC_GITHUB_ROOT } else { 'C:\Support\GitHub' }
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Benchmarks\Compare-ExcelPerformance.ps1 `
    -Suite Standard `
    -OfficeIMORoot (Join-Path $evotecRoot 'OfficeIMO')
```

## Output

Benchmark artifacts are written under `Ignore\Benchmarks\ExcelPerformance` and
`Ignore\Benchmarks\CsvPerformance`:

- `samples.json` / `samples.csv`
- `summary.json` / `summary.csv`
- `comparison.json` / `comparison.md`
- `metadata.json`
- `run-report.json`

Start with `comparison.md` or the generated README table for the comparison,
then use `samples.csv` when diagnosing individual failures.
