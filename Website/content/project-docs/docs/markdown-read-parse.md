Markdown is simple text, but structure-aware parsing is safer than ad hoc regular expressions when documents contain front matter, nested blocks, callouts, tables, task lists, or several Markdown dialects.

## Inspect semantic structures

```powershell
$headings = Get-OfficeMarkdownHeading -InputPath '.\Article.md'
$frontMatter = Get-OfficeMarkdownFrontMatter -InputPath '.\Article.md'
$tables = Get-OfficeMarkdownTable -InputPath '.\Article.md' -AsObject
$nodes = Get-OfficeMarkdownNode -InputPath '.\Article.md' -MaxDepth 3
```

Reader profiles and URL restrictions make parsing behavior explicit. Use heading level, text, anchor, node type, and depth filters to return only the structures the workflow needs.

The [inspect-content recipe](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteOffice/blob/main/Examples/Markdown/Recipe-Markdown-InspectContent.ps1) creates a document with front matter and a table, then reports each parsed structure.
